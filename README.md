# 3D-Ball-Trajectory-Simulator
The goal of this project was to write a program to simulate and draw the trajectory of a ball, given
the coordinates of the point where the ball makes an impact on the ground. The program needed to
calculate the ballâ€™s trajectory, including its motion under the influence of gravity, and display the path
from the ball's starting point to the point of impact with the ground
